# Object Mapping for the Todo API
- Having defined the DTOs for our Todo API, the next step is to implement object mapping. This process allows us to convert between the DTOs and the Todo model, a critical aspect of data transformation in our application.
- To streamline this process, we'll use the AutoMapper library. AutoMapper is a widely-used library that simplifies object-to-object mapping, making it easier to map properties between different objects.
