# Service
In a .NET backend API, a service class is a key component that encapsulates the business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the data access layer (such as repositories) and the presentation layer (such as controllers). The primary responsibilities of a service class include:

# Business Logic: 
Implementing the core business rules and processes of the application. This can include validations, calculations, and other operations that are central to the application's functionality.

# Data Manipulation: 
Interacting with repositories or data access layers to retrieve, create, update, or delete data. The service class typically calls repository methods to perform these actions.

# Abstraction: 
Providing a clean and simple interface for the controllers to interact with. This abstraction helps to keep the controllers thin and focused primarily on handling HTTP requests and responses.

# Transaction Management: 
In some cases, service classes may also handle transaction management, ensuring that a series of operations either complete successfully or roll back in case of failure.

Now, let's create a service class that implements these methods. We'll use Dependency Injection to inject the ITodoServices interface into the service class, making our code more modular, testable, and maintainable.
