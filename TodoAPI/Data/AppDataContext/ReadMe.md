# What is a Database Context
In ASP.NET Core, the database context is a crucial component that manages interactions with the database. It's responsible for tasks such as establishing a connection to the database, querying data, and saving changes.

To enable our Todo API to interact with the database, we need to create a database context.

# Breakdown of the TodoDbContext class:
- TodoDbContext: This class, which inherits from DbContext (a part of Entity Framework Core), is the primary class that interacts with the database.
- _dbsettings: This private field stores the connection string for our database. We inject the DbSettings model, which we created earlier to manage the connection string, into the TodoDbContext class.
- Todos: This property represents the Todo table in our database. It's a DbSet of Todo objects, which allows us to query and save instances of Todo.
- OnConfiguring: This method configures the database provider and connection string. We're using SQL Server as our database provider, and the connection string is retrieved from the DbSettings model.
- OnModelCreating: This method configures the model for the Todo entity. We specify the table name, primary key, and other configurations for the Todo entity.

To use our TodoDbContext for interacting with the database, we need to register it in the Program.cs file. This registration process is part of setting up the Dependency Injection (DI) container in .NET Core.
