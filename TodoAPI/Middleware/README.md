# Global Exception Handling Middleware
- As we progress with our Todo API, it's crucial to implement a mechanism for handling exceptions globally. This ensures that any exceptions that occur during the execution of our application are caught and handled appropriately, providing meaningful error messages to the client.

- .NET 8 introduces the IExceptionHandler interface, which simplifies the process of creating a custom exception handler. This handler will catch all exceptions that occur in our application and return a consistent error response to the client.

# Breakdown of the GlobalExceptionHandler class
- GlobalExceptionHandler: This class implements the IExceptionHandler interface, enabling global exception handling in our application.

- TryHandleAsync: This method is invoked when an exception occurs. It logs the error message, creates an ErrorResponse object, sets the status code and title based on the exception type, and returns a consistent error response to the client.

- ErrorResponse: This class represents the error response returned to the client when an exception occurs. It contains properties for the error message, status code, and title.

- BadHttpRequestException: This case handles exceptions of type BadHttpRequestException and sets the status code and title accordingly.

After setting up the global exception handler, we need to register it in our Program.cs file:
