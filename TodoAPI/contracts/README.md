# DTOs - Data Transfer Objects
In the context of .NET development, a Data Transfer Object (DTO) is 
- a simple object that carries data between processes. 
- It's often used in conjunction with a service layer to shape the data sent between the client and the server.
For our Todo API, we'll define two DTOs: CreateTodoRequest and UpdateTodoRequest. These DTOs will help us enforce the structure and validation of the data sent to our API.

# With these DTOs in place, we're now ready to implement the service layer for our Todo API. With the DTOs defined, we're now ready to implement the Mapping for the Todo API.
